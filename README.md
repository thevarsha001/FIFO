 A FIFO (First-In-First-Out) is a memory queue, which controls the data flow between two modules.This FIFO design is classified as synchronous, as clocks control the read and write operations. Both read and write operations happen simultaneously using of Dual port RAM in the design. Further design and verification is carried out using the Verilog, SystemVerilog and Universal Verification Methodology (UVM) while employing Xilinx Vivado for simulation.

 Code is divided into:-

MAIN CODE
 1. DUT
 2. INTERFACE

TESTBENCH CODE
 1. TRANSACTION
 2. GENERATOR
 3. DRIVER
 4. MONITOR
 5. SCOREBOARD
 6. ENVIRONMENT
 7. TB TOP
